# Glitch 2.0 Agents Documentation

This document serves to provide instructions and guidelines for agents to write, alter, suggest, and test code within this Glitch 2.0 project. All agents should adhere to the following sections to ensure consistency and quality in contributions, unless the user specifies otherwise (by explicitly requesting a different approach).

## Project overview

This project is the repository for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) Team 8727 (Glitch 2.0)'s 2026 codebase. It is built using the WPILib framework and is designed to run on the FRC robots. The codebase includes subsystems, commands, and other files and configurations necessary for robot operation in simulation and real time during the season, during competitions, and during the off-season.

## Build and test commands
To build and test the project, agents should use the following commands:
- To build the project: `./gradlew build`
- To run tests: `./gradlew :test`

## Guidelines for contributing

Please read the file GLITCHDOCS.md for advice before suggesting advice. All contributions must pass all tests, the project should be able to build successfully, and agents should adhere to the project's coding standards (unless the user explicitly requests a different approach). Agents should ensure that their code is well-documented through commenting in the code, logical formatting, and explanation to the user and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
